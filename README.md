# AI Content Orchestration System

An AI-driven, multi-channel content orchestration platform designed to automate daily content workflows.

## Key Capabilities
- Daily automated content generation
- Core idea to multi-platform content transformation
- Platform-specific formatting and tone
- Centralized content pipeline (Idea → Transformed → Ready-to-Publish)
- Human-in-the-loop review and approval

## Repository Structure
- `requirements.md` – Product requirements, scope, and constraints
- `design.md` – System architecture and technical design

## Purpose
This repository is submitted as part of an AI hackathon to demonstrate how AI can enhance digital content workflows through automation, orchestration, and scalability.
